<h1>A hammocking social network</h1>


I'm starting to get tired of watching all of my friends spamming my instagram-feed with hammocking pictures (not gonna lie norwegian nature is beautiful tho). I have decided to build an app that lets people post their favourite hammocking spots and tag them on a map, as well as letting people that visited the spots the positibility to rate them.

Posts can be sorted by highest rating, or nearest spot.

I plan on building the app in react, using firebase for user and data management.
